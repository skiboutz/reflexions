How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
By compairing the two versions, you can instantly see the changes you made so it limits the scope of lines you need to check.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Seeing how a file evolved shows the intentions of the developper and/or the evolution of the architecture. It also makes going back to an old version much easier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The major advantage of manual commit is letting the user choose when a commit makes sense. On the other hand, automatic commit makes sure commits stay small.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Most of the time, documents in Google Docs tend to be unrelated to each other so treating them separately makes sense. 
On the other side, code files like the one usually maintained in Git are often related and it makes more sense to see then in a single commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the entire commit history of a repository's files while git diff show the changes made the the files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
version control creates a safety net allowing me to make pretty massive changes whitout worrying how to get back to working code if it fails!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use git to read some code, branch it try some modification. I also wantto be more fluent with git's commands as it's a tool that might be needed at work.
